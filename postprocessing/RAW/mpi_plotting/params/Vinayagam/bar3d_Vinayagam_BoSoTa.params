# this line is a comment, comments must be on separate lines
# 'input_files'      there will be 1 figure per each input file
# 'columns'          used by master to determine figure dimensions
# 'files_per_pair'   used by master.py to determine how many files to to send to a worker, and by launcher.py to determine #                     the number of workers Pairing is useful is you want worker to impose xlim/ylim per pair for example
# 'walltime'         optional, default = max (30, min(90, num_workers * 3))
# 'xlim','ylim'      optional (not applicable in wheel/bar3d). If not provided, these lims will be pair-specific
