# Network datasets and associated source code:

The case study networks in all our works correspond to experimentally observed physical interactions. Non of the networks contain computationally-inferred or functional (non-physical) interactions. The complete datasets is under /NETWORKs. 

The "input/" subdirectory for each network contains (1) source code (Python) used to curate/clean the source data and (2) detailed documentation (txt) describing where the network dataset was obtained, which interactions were excluded (due to weak experimental evidence for example), and whether the interaction type (positive or negative) is known or was randomly assigned. Networks obtained from databases come with source code (in Python) that can be used to regenerate those networks anew from the a single source (BioGrid) or from multiple sources simultaneously (PSIQUICK).
