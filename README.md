# Evolution by Computational Selection

This repository contains all the sources code for: 

... 1. Running the Network Evolution Problem (NEP) simulations

... 2. Processing visualizing the resulting simulation data

... 3. Running utility scripts such as network stats, generating random analog networks. 

Detailed instruction for 1/2/3 above are included under src/simulation, src/postprocessing and src/utilities.

## I am lost, what is this?

The principle of "Evolution by Computational Selection" relates to the idea that just as natural selection as optimized for better hardware (think: size of girraf's heart, insect skin colour (camouflage), allometry of a lion's jaw, etc), it has also optimized for better "software" in the the manner in which the connectivity of genes (which gene interacts with which). People with computer science background are familiar with the idea that if every object is interacting with every other an an OOP paradignm, the resulting software can't be maintained and is is destined for collapse under its own chaotic weight at some point. Similar organization manifest in biological networks: the topology of such networks is one rather guranatees high maintainability. Maintenance in the context of evolutionary biology is carried out through the process of random variation and non-random selection. The simulation here generate hypothetical evolutionary pressure scenario and assesses the difficulty of maintenance (computational cost, characterized by how many generation will it take before the network has been sufficiently wired away from a bad situation).
