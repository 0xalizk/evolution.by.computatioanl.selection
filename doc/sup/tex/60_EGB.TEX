	\subsection{Effective gained benefit}
			The solution vector to an NEP instance is a sequence $(s_1, s_2, .., s_n), s_i\in\{0,1\},$ where $s_i=1 \mys (s_i=0)$ implies "conserve" ("delete").
			%Equivalently, in KOP context, $s_i=1 (s_i=0)$ implies "inside" ("outside") the knapsack.
			Gained benefits (GB) is the sum of benefits of conserved genes $B_{con}=\{b_i: s_i=1\}$ in an NEP instance's optimal solution. The contribution to GB by genes is shown in Figure SI \ref{EGB} (a), broken down by degree (right legend). Under extremely low tolerance for damaging interactions ($t$=0.1\%, left bar group in (a)), damage-free degree-1 leaf genes contribute ${\sim}$48\% of GB in PPI network compared to ${\sim}$15\% in RN, while majority-degree nodes in NH (degree 4) and NL (degree ${\sim}9\myhyphen 16$), which are less likely to be damage-free (details in Section \ref{prediction_section}), contribute 100\% and  ${\sim}$70\% of GB, respectively. Under relaxed damage tolerance, the contribution of hub genes (blue-shaded slices) to GB in PPI increases sharply from
            ${\sim}$13\% ($t$=0.1\% bar group) to ${\sim}$29\% ($t$=1\%, middle) and ${\sim}$44\% ($t$=5\%, right) although they make up less than 20\% of all PPI's genes (Figure SI \ref{deg_dist} (b)). Relaxing tolerance from 1\% to 5\% no longer changes the gene degree composition in NL and RN networks (note that NL's nodes are almost all of degree 4). Lost benefits (LB) is the sum of benefits of deleted genes $B_{del}=\{b_i: s_i=0\}$ in an NEP instance's optimal solution. Figure SI \ref{EGB} (b) shows the effective GB (EGB) = ${\frac {GB}{GB+LB}}\times 100\%$.
			At stringent $t$=0.1\%, leaf genes in PPI, which contribute zero (degree 1) or minimal (degree 2 and 3 particularly) to LB, result in a higher EGB in PPI compare to other networks whose EGB values are reflective of how many low-degree leaf nodes they have. At 1\% and 5\%, hub nodes become more likely to be included in NEP solutions and begin to contribute significantly to EGB despite their small number. Hubs of degree $\geq$9, $\geq$17, and $\geq$5 make up ${\sim}$10\% of nodes in, respectively, PPI, NL, and RN (see Figure SI  \ref{deg_dist} (b)) but contribute significantly more to EGB in PPI by virtue of its no-damage (degree 1) or minimal-damage (degree 2, 3 particularly) leaf nodes not consuming significant portions of tolerance threshold (recall $t$=0.1\%, 1\%, or \%5 of all damaging interactions in an NEP  instance).


			In reality hub genes perform essential functions  \cite{gerstein_architecture_2012} with evolutionaryexperimentation occurring mostly in less-connected genes around them  \cite{kim_positive_2007}. Hence we simulated an Oracle that tends to advice "advantageous" with more likelihood the higher a gene's degree is (SI \ref{I-sup_biased_oracle}), relative to the network average node degree (${\sim}4, 4, 13,$ and $4$, for PPI, NH, NL and RN respectively). Figure SI \ref{EGB} (c) and (d) show, respectively,  the GB and EGB of these simulations (bar groups and labels being the same as those in (a)). NH and RN have, respectively, zero or minimal number of hub nodes and therefore show identical results as those under random OA in (a) and (b), unlike PPI and NL where hubs contribute more to GB and EGB. NL has significantly more hubs (${\sim}37\%$ of NL's nodes have degree $\geq$ its average node degree 12) compared to PPI (${\sim}22\%$ genes with degree $\geq$ its  average degree 4). However NL's hub contribution to EGB  under hub-favourable Oracle increases by 1, 2, and 5\% compared to 6, 7, and 12\% in PPI under $t=$0.1, 1 and 5\%, respectively (compare blue-shaded slices in \ref{EGB} (b) vs (d)), due to the fact that PPI's hubs have larger degrees relative to average degree compared no NL's. Moreover, PPI's zero or minimal-damage leaf genes minimally consume the tolerance threshold, thereby allowing for the packing of more damage-carrying hub genes into the solution for their benefits and despite their damages.% without exceeding the threshold.
