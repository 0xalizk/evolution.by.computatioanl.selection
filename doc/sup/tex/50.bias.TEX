\section{Hub-favorable Oracle}\label{sup_biased_oracle}
When generating a random OA on gene $g_i$, the likelihood of it being  considered advantageous (i.e. $a_i = +1$) is proportional
to how large the degree of $g_i$ relative to the mean degree.
The probability of of an OA being "advantageous" is 50\% + ($socre(d)\times 100$) where $score(d)$ is a function that relates degrees
(x-axis in Figure SI \ref{supp_bias}) to a conservation score (y-axis) $\in \mathbb{R^+}$.
The OA is "advantageous" with a 100\% probability for any nodes of degree $d$ where $score(d)\geq 0.5$ (grey horizontal line in Figure SI  \ref{supp_bias}).
$\mu$ = the mean node degree, $N$ = number of nodes in the network, and $\alpha\in \mathbb{R^{+}}$ is a calibration constant. The
slope of $score(d)$ is inversely proportional to $\alpha$. We arbitrarily chose $\alpha$=0.2 (dotted line in  Figure SI  \ref{supp_bias}).
Because all nodes in NH are of degree 4 (= the average as well), the OA is always at 50\% chance (coin flip) of being "advantageous" ($score(d)=0$ for
all nodes).
