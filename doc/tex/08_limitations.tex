\section{Model limitations}
  Mathematical models of biological processes range from the highly abstract to the highly detailed. An example of the former is the modelling evolution as a learning algorithm. An example of the latter is describing the concentration of bio-molecules in the cell using differential equations which are subsequently solved repeatedly in a computer simulations of their interactions.

level of abstraction - doesn't detect small perturbations (as no. of neutral genes increases, the topology becomes irrelevant)

oracle doesn't suggest "invent" - gene invention (assume it's part of mutation)

networks may be undirected / unsigned .. randomize. However, doesn't affect central point

not all data are of equal quality

benefit/damages only one edge away - extension
