	The power of random variation (through recombination and/or mutation) and non-random selection
 	to produce fine-tuned hardware has been extensively documented at various biomechanical levels. Classic examples include
    allometric scaling and anatomical adaptations (organism),
    width and material of blood vessels (organ), % \cite{holzapfel_biomechanics_2014},
    compartmentalization of sub-cellular components (cellular) and
    fast-folding and aggressively-functioning enzymes (molecular).

 	%Recent reports have highlighted evidence for `software' optimization in biological systems from a computational complexity perspective, proposing justification for the evolutionary advantage for the role of sex for example \cite{livnat_analytical_2011}.

    It has been debated whether natural selection acts on system-level software traits, particularly those pertaining to the degree distribution and modularity of molecular interaction networks (MINs). Virtually all MINs, irrespective of organism or physiological context of interaction, have a majority (minority) of loosely-connected `leaves' (highly-connected `hubs') interacting with at most 1-3 (at least 10 or more) other genes. Both adaptive and non-adaptive hypothesis for the origin of this majority-leaves minority-hubs (mLmH) topology have been proposed. Both however provide sufficient but not necessary conditions for the emergence of mLmH and therefore one cannot conclusively rule out the plausibility of the other.  Here we model the evolution of MINs  	as a computational optimization problem, which is shown to be fundamentally hard. The problem describes the evolutionary  	pressure on MINs to conserve (delete) beneficial (damaging) genes  	so as to maximize (minimize) the overall number of beneficial (damaging) interactions network-wide.  	Instances of this problem obtained from real MINs are far easier to satisfy compared to those obtained from random networks, a direct  	result of the mLmH topology. Instance difficulty is measured by the combinatorial cost of rewiring the network to an advantageous state given some hypothetical evolutionary pressure. We further use the model to (1) predict the expected percentage of genes having a given degree $d$ based on the computational cost that a gene of degree $d$ adds to the aforementioned  optimization problem, and (2) grow synthetic networks using an evolutionary algorithm that selects for networks which produce the easiest instances. The degree distribution of synthetic networks, after generations of mutate-and-select, closely matches those of real networks of equal size, whether the starting network is random (re-wire edge mutations only) or empty (re-wire edges, add-edge, add-node mutations). Assuming $P\neq NP$, the results provide both sufficient and necessary conditions for the emergence of mLmH topology as an adaptation to circumvent computational intractability.
